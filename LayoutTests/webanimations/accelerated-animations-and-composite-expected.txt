PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' should allow acceleration
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on a keyframe should allow acceleration
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation further up the stack should allow animations in the stack to be accelerated
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack should allow replace animations further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack should allow replace animations with an implicity keyframe further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack targeting a property that isn't accelerated should allow replace animations with implicit keyframes further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' on an effect should not toggle acceleration
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' on a keyframe should not toggle acceleration
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation further up the stack should not toggle acceleration on lower animations in the stack
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack should not toggle acceleration and always allow replace animations further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack should not toggle acceleration on replace animations with an implicity keyframe further up the stack
PASS Dynamically setting 'composite' to 'add' on an animation lower down the stack targeting a property that isn't accelerated shouldn't prevent acceleration of animations with implicit keyframes further up the stack to be accelerated
PASS Adding a composing effect on top of an existing replace effect should not prevent either effect from running accelerated
